# LibGDX-Game
For our project, we created a 2-D style platform game using a Java based framework called Libgdx. The game consist of a main character that has the ability to move freely across world (a series of connected rooms), fight monsters and has certain attributes such as a special attack ability and health. The following keys control the main character:
路      W - jump
路      A - move left
路      D - move right
路      K - dash ability (special attack)
The game also includes a menu screen, which allows the user to start a new game or exit the game. Music and sound effects are also included; the background music plays continues when the game is running, and sound effects are triggered by specific key actions such as when the user presses the jump or special ability key.
